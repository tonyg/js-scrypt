# js-scrypt: Pure-Javascript Emscripten-compiled scrypt routine

[Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten)-compiled
[scrypt](http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html), a Password-Based Key
Derivation Function from Colin Percival.

For general background on what `scrypt` is, and why it's useful, see
[these slides (PDF)](http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt/scrypt-slides.pdf)
and [Colin Percival's page on
scrypt](http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html).

This library is intended only for use in the browser; for node.js,
there are [plenty](https://github.com/cheongwy/node-scrypt)
[of](https://github.com/barrysteyn/node-scrypt)
[existing](https://github.com/hatchan/scrypt) options.

This library was written in order to interoperate with
[js-nacl](https://github.com/tonyg/js-nacl), a cryptographic toolkit
library.

## Building the library

The git checkout includes a pre-compiled version of the library, so
you won't need Emscripten unless you want to change something about
the underlying library itself or how it is compiled.

Essentially, the source checkout contains everything you will need to
use the library in the browser.

## Using the library

In the browser, include the `browser/scrypt-<version>.js` script:

    <script src="browser/scrypt-0.0.1.js"></script>
    ...
    <script> alert(window.scrypt.to_hex(scrypt.random_bytes(16))); </script>

This will add `scrypt` to the `window` object, if that is undesired
the script does have a [UMD](https://npmjs.org/package/umd) wrapper
around it and will work with require.js as well as npm and browserify.

If you need an instance of `scrypt` with the total memory adjusted
from it's default use `scrypt.create(total_memory)`. The create
method takes an optional argument specifying the total memory
available for use by `scrypt()`. If supplied, it must be a power of
two. If omitted, the default is 33,554,432 bytes; 32 megabytes.

The memory assigned to the produced `scrypt` module will not be
released until the module is garbage collected.

## Strings vs. Binary Data

The library enforces a strict distinction between strings and binary
data. Binary data is represented using instances of
[`Uint8Array`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Typed_arrays/Uint8Array).

### scrypt.to_hex(Uint8Array) → String

Returns a lower-case hexadecimal representation of the given binary
data.

### scrypt.encode_utf8(String) → Uint8Array

Returns the binary equivalent of the argument, encoded using UTF-8.

### scrypt.encode_latin1(String) → Uint8Array

Returns the binary equivalent of the argument, encoded using Latin1
(an 8-bit clean encoding). If any of the character codes in the
argument string are greater than 255, an exception is thrown.

### scrypt.decode_utf8(Uint8Array) → String

Decodes the binary data in the argument using the UTF-8 encoding,
producing the corresponding string.

### scrypt.decode_latin1(Uint8Array) → String

Decodes the binary data in the argument using the Latin1 8-bit clean
encoding, producing the corresponding string.

## Using `crypto_scrypt`

To generate *L* bytes of derived key material from a password *passwd*
and a salt *salt*,

 - choose *N*, **which must be a power of two**, which will set the
   overall difficulty of the computation. The scrypt paper uses
   2<sup>14</sup>=16384 for interactive logins, and
   2<sup>20</sup>=1048576 for file encryption, but running in the
   browser is slow so Your Mileage Will Almost Certainly Vary.

 - choose *r* and *p*. Good values are r=8 and p=1. See the scrypt
   paper for details on these parameters.

Choose wisely! Picking good values for N, r and p is important for
making your keys sufficiently hard to brute-force.

Ensure your password and salt are both represented as
[`Uint8Array`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Typed_arrays/Uint8Array)
instances, perhaps by calling `scrypt.encode_utf8` or similar.

Then,

    var keyBytes = scrypt.crypto_scrypt(password, salt, N, r, p, L);

and `keyBytes` will contain *L* bytes of key material.

For example,

    scrypt.crypto_scrypt(scrypt.encode_utf8("pleaseletmein"),
                         scrypt.encode_utf8("SodiumChloride"),
                         16384, 8, 1, 64)

produces 64 bytes of key material,

    e61e85dc0d651e40dfcf017b45575887

as a `Uint8Array`.
